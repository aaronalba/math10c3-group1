The cube worked as a myriad of artistic creativity so that the group members could shine in their respective fields: the colored faces became the visual artists' canvas, while the concept of the cube became a prompt for the writers.","Why the Rubik's cube? The Rubik's cube is a unique invention borne from mathematical concepts like permutations, geometry, and algorithms. Creator Ern\u0151 Rubik initially formulated the puzzle to demonstrate three-dimensional movement as a learning exercise, but its global popularity has changed the world's approach to puzzle-solving. Competitions that showcase skills of speed solving, creation of different versions of the cube (hexagon cubes or 2x2 cubes) that push more complicated deciphering, and representations in film and media prove that the Rubik's cube has influenced the math world and the general public.","Aside from the puzzle's distinct relations to mathematics, the group also saw its connections to our life experiences.

This then leads us to the utility of studying patterns, thus resulting in the concept of algorithms. From the everyday routines of each person to larger scopes like predicting the following possible data during this pandemic, we can observe the workings of algorithms.","The very idea of an Algorithm is to input a set of rules/instructions that step-by-step define how a work is to be executed to get the expected results  (Introduction to Algorithms, 2019). A simple and good example would be solving the Rubik's cube as it follows a specific set of rules to complete the puzzle.

Until now, we can still observe the importance of geometry as we can see its application in arts, architecture, agriculture, medicine, and even the natural environment around us. Geometry is the visual study of shapes, sizes, patterns, and how they fit together in space. Geometry is responsible for giving video games a realistic look to the landscape and the characters that inhabit the game\u2019s virtual world. Besides helping computer designers build virtual realities, geometry\u2019s applications in the real world include architecture, computer-aided manufacturing, medicine, biology, physical sciences, and much more."],je=["Who would have known that even a plant in nature could be connected to mathematics? The sunflower has been linked to many mathematical concepts, one being the golden angle or golden ratio. The sequence of the seeds follows a golden angle which makes up the pattern of a Fibonacci sequence. According to a study by Prusinkiewicz and Lindenmayer (1990), the golden angle is approximately 137.5\xb0, and the seeds seem to follow this. Since the angle is considered irrational, it means no seed has a neighboring one at the exact angle from the center. The result of this arrangement would be a spiral pattern of sunflower seeds. Other than that, the sunflower has been used in a Lemma. A Lemma is a \u201cmini theorem\u201d or something that has been proven true but isn\u2019t major enough to become a theorem. If you make sets of numbers with each having a shared number and plot it, each set would look like petals, where the middle has the shared or common number between the sets."],ye=["Sometimes it is better to know what the future may hold and prepare for different scenarios than know nothing at all. The concept of permutations enables us to learn different combinations and sequences of variables, have a finite number of scenarios, and find the oddity of getting the desired result. In mathematics, permutation refers to the arrangement of all members of a set into various sequences or orders. Combination, on the other hand, is a way of selecting items from a collection where the order of selection does not matter. Like in a Rubik\u2019s cube, there are 43 quintillions, 252 quadrillions, 3 trillion, 274 billion, 489 million, 856 thousand. The number of combinations is a lot, but by following specific steps, there will be a much shorter and fewer moves way to finish a cube.
